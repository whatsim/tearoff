			|	What's Tearoff
		p
			|	It's very simple. Tearoff is a Markdown text box that posts on the internet, and removes it later.
			|	Thats it, thats all it does. You can link to images, or whatever you like, set the number of views, and share the link. 
		p
			|	When the view count hits what you set when posting, or the set number of days elapses, that content goes away.
