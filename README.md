### Tearoff

Tearoff will be a webservice that provides a way to post text content that has a set expiration condition. It provides a way to post a piece of information publicly and have it go away on its own after X number of views, or X period of time.

Potential use case, you're doing a promotion of Twitter or a livestream and need to give away a semi private piece of information to a set number of people, like an ip to your modded Minecraft server. Tearoff will do that.

Another, you want to post fliers for an event that link to information about the event but only allow a certain number of people to look into it for crowd control, or want the information to go away after the event happens.

Tearoff probably won't do rich content, but you can feel free to link to stuff elsewhere.
